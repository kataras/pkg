Zero work from me, there is a library which does the same thing I coded as well, so we will use that instead.
This folder exists for two reasons;
1. in order to vendor that package, which is; https://github.com/jinzhu/copier and
2. if we want to change in the future we will change the function body, not the import path of the projects that uses this package.
